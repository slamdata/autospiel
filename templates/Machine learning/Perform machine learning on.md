[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is not a normal tabular data format. Unlike tabular data the structure of each piece of JSON is tailored to a specific purpose. For example a piece of JSON for a form about you and your pets would have a very different structure to a piece of JSON for a manufacturing dashboard. Machine learning models expect standard tabular data just as spreadsheets and charts do. In order to use JSON to train our models and make predictions we need to transform it into meaningful tables.

REFORM lets you access [{{souce_name}}]({{source_url}}) as tables in [{{dest_name}}]({{dest_url}}) for training and prediction. Simply provide the details of the {{source_instance}}, browse even the most complex data as if it were a file browser and pick what you're interested in. {{dest_ingest_instructions}}

REFORM also supports use cases where data needs additional JOINs or GROUP BYs before being used for machine learning. REFORM will transform your data into tables in {{dest_supported_sql}} which support JOINs and GROUP BYs and can be used as data sources by {{dest_name}}.
