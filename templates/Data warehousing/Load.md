[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is not a normal tabular data format. Unlike tabular data the structure of each piece of JSON is tailored to a specific purpose. For example a piece of JSON for a form about you and your pets would have a very different structure to a piece of JSON for a manufacturing dashboard. {{dest_name}} expects standard tabular data. In order to warehouse JSON data and use it to find insights we need to transform it into meaningful tables.

REFORM lets you load [{{source_name}}]({{source_url}}) into tables in [{{dest_name}}]({{dest_url}}). Simply provide the details of the {{source_instance}}, browse even the most complex data as if it were a file browser and pick what you're interested in. {{dest_ingest_instructions}}

![{{dest_ingest_image_alt}}]({{dest_ingest_image}})

REFORM supports datasets of all sizes even if they are too large to fit onto a single computer. Your data will stream from {{source_name}} thorugh REFORM and into analytic ready tables in {{dest_name}}.
