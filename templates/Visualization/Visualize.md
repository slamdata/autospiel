[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is not a normal tabular data format. Unlike tabular data the structure of each piece of JSON is tailored to a specific purpose. For example a piece of JSON for a form about you and your pets would have a very different structure to a piece of JSON for a manufacturing dashboard. {{source_name}} expects standard tabular data. In order to visualize JSON data and find insights we need to transform it into meaningful tables.

REFORM lets you access [{{source_name}}]({{source_url}}) as tables in [{{dest_name}}](({{dest_url}}) for visualization and analysis. Simply provide the details of the {{source_instance}}, browse even the most complex data as if it were a file browser and pick what you're interested in. {{dest_ingest_instructions}}

![{{dest_ingest_image_alt}}]({{dest_ingest_image}})

REFORM also supports situations where the data is too large to fit onto a single computer and situations where data needs to be analysed at scale. REFORM will stream your data directly into tables in {{dest_supported_sql}} which support any size of dataset at scale and can easily be used as data sources by {{dest_name}}.
